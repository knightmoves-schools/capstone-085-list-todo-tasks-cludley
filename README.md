the task board:
- should list each card with a unique id that contains "task-" followed by the `index within the tasks array`

- should contain a delete link within each card that contains the corresponding `index within the tasks array`

Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Develop programs for multiple computing platforms. (3B-AP-19) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Use lists to simplify solutions, generalizing computational problems instead of repeatedly using simple variables. (3A-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
